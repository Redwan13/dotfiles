# dotfiles

Collection of dotfiles and other system configs.

* Vim - config is targeted to neovim, but the only difference is Vundle bundles path. 
  * Don't forget to install [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) to install all other plugins.
  * Autocomplete [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe). Read its manual, damn you.
* Awesome - configs for awesome wm. 
  * **WORK IN PROGRESS** still not usable.
  * Also submodule with awmtt - testing script for awesome config.
* Other confs (git, svn, tmux) are selfdescribing.
